# Koa.js Learning Project

## What I Learned
This project demonstrates my exploration of Koa.js, a modern and lightweight web framework for Node.js. Through building a simple application for managing a list of things I love, I learned several key concepts:

### Core Concepts
* Middleware architecture using async/await
* Router implementation with koa-router
* Template rendering using koa-ejs
* Request body parsing with koa-bodyparser
* JSON response formatting with koa-json

### Features
* Simple CRUD operations
* Server-side rendering with EJS templates
* Dynamic routing
* Form handling and data management

## Why Koa.js vs Express.js
### Advantages of Koa.js

#### 1. Modern JavaScript Support
* Built-in async/await support without additional configuration
* Cleaner handling of asynchronous operations compared to Express's callback approach

#### 2. Middleware Stack
* Bidirectional middleware flow (downstream and upstream)
* Better error handling through try/catch blocks
* More intuitive middleware composition

#### 3. Lightweight Core
* Smaller footprint than Express
* No bundled middleware, allowing for more flexibility
* Only essential features included in core package

#### 4. Context Object
* Enhanced context object (ctx) that encapsulates both request and response
* Eliminates the need to pass around req and res objects
* More elegant API for handling HTTP requests and responses

### Use Case Considerations

Koa.js is particularly well-suited for:
* Modern Node.js applications leveraging ES6+ features
* Projects requiring clean and maintainable middleware structure
* Applications needing robust error handling
* Developers who prefer minimal frameworks with extensible architecture

## Note
This is a learning project focused on understanding the basics of Koa.js. The data is currently stored in memory rather than a database.
